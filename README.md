esigning a basic portfolio website using HTML and CSS is an essential step for any developer looking to showcase their skills, projects, and personal brand on the web. A portfolio site serves as a digital resume and project archive, making it easier for potential employers, clients, or collaborators to understand your capabilities and experience. With just HTML and CSS, you can build a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing portfolio that reflects your personality and style while remaining responsive and accessible on different devices.

The core structure of the website is built using HTML, which defines the content and layout of each section. Typically, the site starts with a header that includes the developer's name, title (such as "Front-End Developer" or "Full-Stack Engineer"), and a simple navigation menu that links to different parts of the page, like "Projects," "About," and "Contact." This allows users to easily browse through the website and find relevant information.

The main highlight of the portfolio is the "Projects" section, where developers can list their work. Each project is presented in a card-like format that includes a title, a brief description, and a link to the live demo or GitHub repository. This not only showcases technical abilities but also gives visitors a clear view of what the developer has built. HTML is used to create these content blocks, while CSS is applied to style them — using background colors, borders, padding, grid layouts, and hover effects to make the section visually engaging.
The "About" section gives visitors insight into the developer’s background, passion, skills, and goals. This is an opportunity to introduce oneself and build a connection with the audience. The "Contact" section provides essential contact details such as email, GitHub, and LinkedIn links. This encourages networking and potential job opportunities.
